About:
======

An unofficial attempt of localizing Stack Exchange sites into Japanese, 
with a focus on the Japanese Language and Usage site. 

For more information, please see:
http://stackapps.com/questions/2978/japanese-stack-exchange-localization

Supported browsers:
===================

Currently testing it only on Google Chrome and Firefox with Greasemonkey, 
but I intend to support other browsers later.

What's currently translated:
============================

* Most of the tag names on the JLU website 
  (the detailed descriptions aren't translated).

* A majority of the badge names and descriptions. Some descriptions 
  on the badges page haven't been filled in as they were too difficult 
  for me to translate.

* Most of the tabs, UI elements etc on the main page, questions page, 
  tags page, users page and unanswered page.

* The Stack Exchange dropdown's tabs, e-mail settings, the notifications 
  tab and site names have been localized, but the descriptions of the 
  sites haven't. I intend to do them later.
  
* The "user reputation changes" changes popup at the top.

* I've translated some of the WMD editor's tooltips and redirected to 
  a brief editing guide in Japanese for now (the "mini JavaScript help" 
  and "detailed help" haven't been translated).

* The user profile pages and the tabs in them are mostly localized.

* The "community moderator tools" have largely been localized, but the 
  "review" page hasn't been yet. I intend to do it later.
  
* I don't intend to translate the "about", "FAQ" or "privileges" pages 
  (aside from the names of the privileges) for now, though there are 
  separate efforts to write Japanese documentation at 
  http://meta.japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/625/
